# Running the App

To start the development server:

```
cd my-app
```

```
npm run dev
```

This will run the Vite development server at `http://localhost:3000`. 

The page will reload when you make changes to the code. You will see any lint errors in the console.

Some things to try:

- Make edits to App.tsx to customize the content
- Add new pages by creating `.tsx` files under `src/pages` 
- Install and import new components from npm

## Production Build 

To create a production build:

```
npm run build
```

This will build the app for production to the `dist` folder. 

The build is minified, optimized, and your app is now ready
